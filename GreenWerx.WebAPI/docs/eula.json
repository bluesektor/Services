    VOLUNTEERS AND  GreenWerx.org
</p> <p>
    GreenWerx.org appreciates the significant contributions made by volunteers, who assist  GreenWerx.org in its efforts to provide high quality,
    community driven online services. To help achieve this goal,  GreenWerx.org volunteers perform a variety of technical and non-technical tasks,
    including, but not limited to, programming, the creation of web-based content (HTML, BML, and other formats), graphic design, audio and/or
    visual content creation, technical writing, managing electronic data libraries and/or databases, technical support, reviewing, categorizing,
    legal assistance, archiving and/or forwarding electronic data, providing expert advice, administration, management, accounting, research, content creation,
    promotions, or other assignments, as needed. All volunteers are expected to be of legal age, or volunteering with the consent of a legal parent or guardian.
</p> <p>
    By accepting these Terms of Service, any  GreenWerx.org member agrees that the intellectual content created as a result of volunteer
    work for  GreenWerx.org constitutes intellectual property of  GreenWerx.org and that all rights in said content shall vest in  GreenWerx.org at the time that it is created, to the extent permitted by law. If laws prevent such vesting, the volunteer makes assignment of all such rights to  GreenWerx.org at the time of creation. If laws prevent such assignment, the volunteer grants a perpetual world wide irrevocable license to  GreenWerx.org to use said content. If laws prevent such licensing, the volunteer agrees never to sue  GreenWerx.org for the use of said content.

</p> <p>
    The volunteer certifies that any electronic data he/she submits is his/her work and that to the best of the volunteer’s knowledge,
    the electronic data is not claimed by another. The volunteer agrees to insure that any work provided is correct, error free and does not
    contain any inflammatory language, indecency or obscenities. Furthermore, if said work is found to be illegally presented, claimed, or forged,
    GreenWerx.org may remove such material and, at  GreenWerx.org’s discretion, seek action against the individual(s) from which the work originated.
    No  GreenWerx.org user is required to become a volunteer to this service, and users without volunteer status will receive reasonable support and
    attention as well. Without the expressed written confirmation to the contrary, all  GreenWerx.org positions are assumed to be taken without pay or
    future consideration.
