7.1. Licensee may not access or use the GreenWerx.org API for any purposes if it is a direct competitor of GreenWerx.
7.2. End Users shall be Subscribers to Services. Licensee must use best efforts to ensure that GreenWerx.org Applications do not permit End Users who are not Subscribers to access or use the Services. In the event Licensee discovers that an End User is not a Subscriber, Licensee shall use best efforts to prevent that End User from using the GreenWerx.org Application.
7.3. With respect to the GreenWerx.org Applications, Licensee acknowledges and agrees that GreenWerx.org has no obligations, responsibilities, or liabilities to End Users.
7.4. Licensee must comply with the restrictions set forth in this Agreement and the EULA in all uses of the GreenWerx.org API, Account Data, and the Services.

7.5. Licensee’s GreenWerx.org Application must not be intended to or designed to facilitate a violation of the EULA or this Agreement by End Users, including without limitation the use policies set forth in the EULA. In the event GreenWerx.org reasonably believes Licensee’s GreenWerx.org Application violates this Section 7.5, Licensee shall, promptly upon written notice and at Licensee’s sole cost, modify and redistribute the GreenWerx.org Application and use its best efforts to disable or otherwise prevent End Users from using prior versions of the GreenWerx.org Application that violate this Section 7.5. In no event will Licensee encourage its End Users to violate, or instruct its End Users on how to violate, the EULA or this Agreement.

7.7. Licensee’s GreenWerx.org Applications shall not substantially replicate products or services offered by GreenWerx, including, without limitation, functions or clients on platforms (such as iOS or Android) where GreenWerx.org offers its own client or a substantially similar function. By way of example only, Licensee may not develop a GreenWerx.org Application for use on an iPhone that permits an End User to make general phone calls to the public switched telephone network because doing so would substantially replicate GreenWerx’s mobile application for the iPhone. Licensee agrees that GreenWerx.org may develop and publish applications that are similar to or otherwise compete with Licensee’s applications.
7.8. GreenWerx.org Applications may not use or access the GreenWerx.org API or the Services in order to monitor the availability, performance, or functionality of the GreenWerx.org API or Services or for any similar benchmarking or competitive purposes.

7.12. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Licensee is solely responsible, and that GreenWerx.org has no responsibility or liability of any kind, for (a) the content, development, operation, sale, support, or maintenance of GreenWerx.org Applications; or (b) Licensee’s inability to continue providing GreenWerx.org Applications (in whole or part) due to the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

The Subscriber must provide express consent prior to any Account Access, and such consent shall be limited to the scope of what is disclosed in the previous sentence (the “Subscriber’s Access Consent”). Licensee shall promptly cease any Account Access upon the Subscriber’s withdrawal of the Subscriber’s Access Consent.
7.15. In no event shall Licensee or the GreenWerx.org Application engage in Account Access or transmit, store, or access Account Data outside the scope of the Subscriber’s Access Consent.
7.16. Sections 7.14 to 7.15 shall not apply to the extent (and only to the extent) that Licensee uses a GreenWerx.org Application solely with its own subscription to the Services. Licensee’s consent to such Account Access shall be deemed given in such cases.
